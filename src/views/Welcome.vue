<strong style="font-size:21px;margin-top: 24px;">Miners</strong>
<p> To sign up for the mining competition, you'll need to <a href="https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Mining-Contest:-Competitor-Checklist#install-the-polkadotjs-extension" target="_blank">install the polkadot{.js} wallet extension</a>. We have a <a href="https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/%5ENewbie-Mining-Contest-Getting-Started-Guide%5E" target="_blank">new user's guide</a> to help contestants get started.</p>
<ul>
<li>Login to the TEA browser wallet.</li>
<li>You can sign up directly through <a href="https://wallet.teaproject.org/#/leader_board">the Leader board</a> by clicking on the <strong>Register for competition</strong> button at the top of that page.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfb1fjb_Pyfkfa4zOORoWoZcbWJ61OO5r1Egp2CcYsbdwtIeQ/viewform?ts=621ea246" target="_blank">COFFEE purchase form</a> to buy your COFFEE. Note that when contestants purchase COFFEE, their wallets will be deposited with enough TEA which should provide enough gas for their first few transactions.</li>
<li>Wait for your COFFEE to be transferred to your Polkadot wallet. This is currently a manual process so please be patient. You'll be notified by email when they've been transferred, after which you can exchange them for TEA.</li>
<li>Visit the <a href="https://wallet.teaproject.org/#/auction_store">Marketplace</a> to purchase B CML. Once you have B CML, you can setup your mining machine by following the <a href="https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/%5ENewbie-Mining-Contest-Getting-Started-Guide%5E" target="_blank">new user's guide</a>.</li>
</ul>

  <strong style="margin-top:20px;display:block;font-size:21px;">Basic concept of plant and staking</strong>
  <p>You can use your TEA browser wallet to earn TEA tokens through mining or staking. Mining TEA requires planting a Camellia (CML) NFT into a mining machine and paying 1000T for the initial staking slot. Staking can be done on any mining machine operating on the TEA network. Each staking slot requires either 1000T or 1 CML. You may stake or unstake every 1000 blocks.</p>

  <strong style="margin-top:20px;display:block;font-size:21px;">Disclaimer</strong>
  By participating in the TEA mining contest, you acknowledge and agree to the following:
  <ul>
  <li>The CML that are purchased through the form are only for the contest and are not mainnet CML.</li>
  <li>The contest allows for many different strategies, some of which might not be profitable (i.e. there's no guarantee of profit or rewards for participating in the mining contest).</li>
  <li>The blockchain can be restarted at any time during testing which will result in your wallet balances being reset.</li>
  <li>The TEA Project team reserves the right to end the contest early or alter the rules at any time.</li>
  </ul>
